#
# GPG script to encrypt a file with our best settings.
#
# Example:
#
#     $ gpg-encrypt foo.txt
#     (prompt for password)
#     (prompt for password again)
#     #=> foo.txt.gpg
#
# Settings:
#
#    * Symmetric encryption, i.e. we use the same password for encryption and decryption.
#      We choose this because our users can understand symmetric more easily than asymmetic.
#
#    * Encryption using the aes256 cipher algorithm.
#      We choose this because it's a good balance of strong and portable.
#
#    * digesting using the sha256 digest algorithm.
#      We choose this because it's a good balance of strong and portable.
#
#    * No compression, because typically our files are small or already compressed.
#      We choose this to maximize portability, PGP compatibility, and speed.
#
# To get our settings, we use these gpg options:
#
#    --quiet                       Try to be as quiet as possible.
#    --no-greeting                 Suppress the initial copyright message but do not enter batch mode.
#    --symmetric                   Encrypt with symmetric cipher only This command asks for a passphrase.
#    --cipher-algo aes256          Use AES256 as the cipher algorithm
#    --digest-algo sha256          Use SHA256 as the digest algorithm.
#    --cert-digest-algo sha256     Use SHA256 as the message digest algorithm used when signing a key.
#    --compress-algo none          Do not compress the file.
#    -z 0                          Compression level set to 0, i.e. set to no compression.
#    --no-use-agent                Do not use a system agent such as Ubuntu's gnome-keyring process.
